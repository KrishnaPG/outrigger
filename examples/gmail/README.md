# Gmail

These examples show ways to read messages from a gmail account and categorize the messages as well as writing the results of programs back to gmail by sending messages.

A [detailed walkthrough](https://github.com/juttle/juttle-gmail-adapter/blob/master/docs/adapter_impl_notes.md) of the adapter implementation is available if you want to use it as a basis for writing your own adapters.

## Additional docker-compose configuration

None needed.

## ``juttle-config.json`` configuration

Modify `juttle-config.json` to add a ``juttle-gmail-adapter`` section containing credentials to access messages via the Gmail API:

{
  "adapters": {
    "juttle-gmail-adapter": {
      "client-credentials": {
        "installed": {
          "client_id": "--your-client-id--",
          "project_id": "--your-project-id",
          "auth_uri": "https:\/\/accounts.google.com\/o\/oauth2\/auth",
          "token_uri": "https:\/\/accounts.google.com\/o\/oauth2\/token",
          "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https:\/\/www.googleapis.com\/oauth2\/v1\/certs",
          "client_secret": "--your-client-secret-id--",
          "redirect_uris": [
            "urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob",
            "http:\/\/localhost"
          ]
        }
      },
      "oauth2-token": {
        "access_token": "---your-access-token---",
        "token_type": "Bearer",
        "refresh_token": "---your-refresh-token---",
        "expiry_date": DDDDDDDDDDDDD
      }
    }
  }
}

The full set of steps to generate these credentials is [on the README](https://github.com/juttle/juttle-gmail-adapter) page on github.

## Juttle Programs

To run any of these programs, just visit
``http://(localhost|docker machine ip):8080/run?path=/examples/gmail/index.juttle``
and follow the links.

### Categorizing messages by recipient

This program reads all messages from the last 12 hours, categorizes the messages by sender, and displays a table and bar chart with the counts. The gmail search expression is configurable.

View this program: [messages_by_sender.juttle](./messages_by_sender.juttle)

### Categorizing messages by time

This program reads all messages from the last 12 hours, batches the messages by time received in 30 minute groups, and displays a timechart with the counts. This program shows how juttle field matches map to message properties by only selecting those messages sent specifically to "me" (i.e. the gmail account owner).

### Writing results by sending messages

This program emits a small set of artificial data and writes the result by sending an email. The email contains the data as a JSON attachment to the email. (The output is also written to a table so it can be viewed in outrigger).
