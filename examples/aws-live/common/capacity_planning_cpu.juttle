// This subgraph can be used to guide decisions on capacity planning
// for any AWS Product that has a CloudWatch metric called
// 'CPUUtilization' (e.g. EC2, RDS, ElastiCache). It shows the average
// CPU Utilization for all items (EC2 instances/RDS
// databases/ElastiCache clusters) over a recent timeframe as well as
// the idle time for the same set of items.
//
// If the CPU Utilization is close to 100%, you may want to consider
// adding more instances/databases/etc to spread the work across more
// items.
